I am a BSc in Neuroscience and a PhD Student at UFABC from Brazil. One topic that makes me extremely curious is how early life events can promote different neurodevelopmental outcomes and cause long lasting consequences. I currently research how prenatal stress modulate the placental imprintoma and the implications of this process on fetal programming, especially in the neurodevelopment.

I love microglia, my undergrad research project covered basically neuroimmunology and neonatal anoxia. I'm also kinda into Data Science and Systems Biology :v:
