Well, this topic appear when i was reading some neuroimmune articles and it's seens really interesting to present here in a fun and informative manner.

### What's a sickness behavior?

Well, it's a behavior... *definition*

The title of this post is kinda goofy, but hey feeling ill make anyone sad!
But why, and how, it's related with the brain and the microglias? What even are those microglias and why would they want to hurt me? So many questions.

### Inflammation

Pathways that send signals to the brain microglia!

Introduce microglia (the microglia desearve a proper introduction!)

The response come correlated with a behavior

It's interisting to think how neuroinflammation could modulate behavior, and it's even more curious when we look into the behaviors change, that is familiar sindrome...

### This is similar to...

Depression and other similar conditions! Yeah, you're right!
