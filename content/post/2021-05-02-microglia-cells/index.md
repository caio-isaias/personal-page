### Hortega, a cool neuroscientist with a not so cool mentor

We could say that there's a gossip, or as we call it in portuguese *fofoca*, in the discovery of microglia . 

Even though it seens that Nissl stained the microglia cells and obtained some really cool pictures in his time, only Pio Del Rio Hortega, through an ammoniacal silver carbonate modification of the Golgi technique, have identified, described and named the microglia cells. Hortega did a really good job discovering the glia cells, he also found the oligodendrocites, as reported on his publication "the third element of the brain", but with this article hortega carrer didnt end well... Cajal made sure of it.



Well, maybe someone would disagree calling as 'not so cool mentor' the *father of neuroscience*, and a Nobel Laureate, but what we can do? He failed to recognize the microglia there and even fired who discovered it. ~~*Irony alert!!*~~
