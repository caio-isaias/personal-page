### Why a site and a blog?

When I built this website I did it having in mind a platform to introduce myself, exhibit my projects, get used to writing in English, and maybe share some of my ideas on topics that interest me, like neurodevelopment, machine learning, complex networks, or **neuroscience** and **data science** in general.

So at the moment, I hope that I can improve my English by doing some science communication posts on this blog!

### Let's talk about science!

I have some ideas about what topics can appear in future posts. We can talk about the incredible **microglia** cells and their neuroimmune or neurodevelopmental functions. We can also talk about **fetal and placental programming** on neurodevelopmental disorders, or even about **graph theory**, complex network properties, and their usefulness on **systems biology**!
